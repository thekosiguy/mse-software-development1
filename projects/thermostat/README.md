# Thermostat

![](./images/thermostat-styled.png)

### Task

Here's the [specification](./specification.md) to build the business logic to model a simple thermostat. You'll then hook it up to a dynamic visual interface using jQuery - all within the browser. Finally, you'll use fetch data from external sources and display them on the page - again, all using JS.

## Steps

* [Thermostat: business logic](business-logic.md)
* [Thermostat: interface](interface.md)
* [Thermostat: jQuery](jquery.md)
* [Thermostat: APIs](apis.md)
* [Thermostat: styling](styling.md)

## The Count project

The [Count](https://github.com/dearshrewdwit/count) project is a tiny, model full stack web app.  It exemplifies:

* Making Ajax requests.
* Testing frontend code.
* Separating frontend concerns using a component approach.

It's very worthwhile spending time investigating and playing with the code in this project to understand how it works.
