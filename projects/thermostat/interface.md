# Thermostat: interface

[Back to the Project Map](README.md)

You now have some well tested business logic, representing simple model of a thermostat. However, at the moment, the only way you can interact with the code is either through the console or tests. It's time to build a user interface.

In this challenge, you will build the skeleton of a UI, so that you can then start interacting with your underlying logic.

### Learning Objectives covered

- Using HTML/CSS to create a user interface on the web.

### To complete this challenge, you will need to:

- [ ] Decide what HTML elements you will need to serve as controls on the thermostat.  Decide what HTML elements you will need to display the thermostat data.
- [ ] Build a static HTML page with these elements, labelling them with appropriate classes and/or IDs.
- [ ] You don't need to hook up your thermostat model to the user interface.  That comes in the next challenge!
- [ ] Add a `script` tag with `type="module"` attribute-value pair to load an app runner. This app runner should `import` your thermostat JavaScript file into the page, and instantiate it.
- [ ] Check you're ready by logging to the console in your app runner the current temperature and verify you see the log by opening the developer console
