# Build Day

### Learning Objectives
- Apply your skills so far and build an app
- Explain and present your work to your peers

## Task
Your app could be one or more of the following
- an app that consumes data from an [API](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis) (eg GitHub API)
- a game (eg: tic tac toe, battleships, Game of Life)
- a tool (eg: linter, test-framework, other)

Decide what kind of app you'd like to build and any data that you need for it, then go through a short design process to generate mockups and user journeys so you an start work.

### Design Process

#### Part 1
1. Brainstorm all possible interactions you'd love your app to support.
2. Prioritise them
3. Break these down into smaller interactions or steps
4. Decide what constitutes your MVP -  Likely the first couple of interactions at most. Be ruthless!

#### Part 2
4. Flesh out user journeys for the MVP interactions with wireframes and mockups
5. Diagram a domain model to help you focus on how to implement your first interaction
6. Codify the first user interaction in a feature test
7. Start work!

### Feature Freeze
Pay attention to your Discord channel - your coach will send out a message with the feature freeze begins. What does this mean? No more features! Focus on making sure your app runs locally, and think about your presentation.

### Presentations
- You have a maximum of 3 mins
- Demo the user interaction you're most proud of
- Explain what your app does (what problem does it solve?)
- What did you learn/enjoy?
- You can use slides if you'd like
